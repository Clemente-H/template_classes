## How to Use

### 1. Create or edit a class

Edit or add a file inside:

```
clases/claseXX.tex
```

Each class contains its own sections and slides.

---

### 2. Select which class to compile

In `main.tex`:

```latex
\input{clases/clase02}
```

---

### 3. Compile

Just save the file.

VS Code + LaTeX Workshop will:

* Compile automatically
* Open the PDF
* Sync source ↔ PDF

---

## Customization

### Theme & Layout

Edit:

```
config/theme.tex
```

Includes:

* Colors
* Header style
* Section slides
* Footer
* Title page

---

### Logo

Replace:

```
images/logos/cenia_logo.png
```

No other changes required.

---

### Section Slides

Section slides are created automatically using:

```latex
\section{Title}
```

Their appearance is controlled in `theme.tex`.

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. Duplicate this folder for a new course
2. Edit `main.tex`
3. Add or modify files in `clases/`
4. Compile

No need to touch the theme again.
